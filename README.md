**Task 1:** Create a Dictionary of Student Marks  
**Description:**  
I have created a dictionary mapping student names to their marks. Then prompts the user to input a student's name. Using .get() method, it retrieves and displays the marks if the student exists. If not found, it prints a user-friendly message indicating the "Student not found".  
**Expected Output:**  
Enter the student's name: Poornasai  
Poornasai's marks: 98  

**Task 2:** Demonstrate List Slicing  
**Description:**  
I have created a list of integers from 1 to 10. And used Python's list slicing syntax to extract the first five elements efficiently. Next, reversed the extracted first five elements using .reverse() method. Finally, it prints the original list, extracted list and the reversed list to demonstrate list manipulation.  
**Expected Output:**  
Original list:  [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]  
Extracted first five elements:  [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]  
Reversed extracted elements:  [5, 4, 3, 2, 1]
